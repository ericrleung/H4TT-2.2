Title: The Files Are In The Computer
Description:

-----------------
Catagory Description:
We were able to copy one of E Corp's servers to this VM.
Looks like someone else already gained access to the machine. See if you can figure out if they left anything there.
To run it: ssh ecorp@52.24.114.70
We know the username is ecorp. Not sure what the password is; but if they got pwned already, it can't be that hard to guess.

Challenge Description:
file1.txt
