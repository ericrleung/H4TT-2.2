The challenge uses AES in ECB mode. This means that the same key is reused. So the same coloured pixels will
still look similar to one another. This means that if you can make the file back into an image you will be
able to see the shame of the image (more than enough for white text on a black background in this case).

To make the file into a readable file, you will want to open the file an a text editor and add to the top
of the file:
P6
1000 500
255
<rest of file here>

Viewing the file as an image now will result in a sufficiently clear image to read the flag. This is all
done without knowing the key that was used to encrypt in the first place.

flag{KEYLESS-AES}
